# Git'er Done

Git'er Done is a node.js starter kit.  You won't find anything fancy here, just the way I start all my node.js projects. I know about complexity but I don't see the point if I'm constantly trying to figure out how it works instead of getting the features done. Plus I'm not very comfortable with the structure/coding style of many frameworks.  Node.js provides the environment to keep it simple.  The side effect, this kit provides a good starting point for learning.
